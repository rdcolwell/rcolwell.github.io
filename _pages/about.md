I am a PhD student in the Materials Science & Engineering Department at the University of Washington in Professor Eleftheria Roumeli's group where I study biomass-derived materials for sustainability applications. I am particularly interested in understanding how to exploit fundamental structure-property relationships to engineer high-performing biomaterials to replace incumbent fossil-derived plastics.

Outside of lab, I enjoy listening to -- and writing -- music, experimenting with how to healthify recipes, and putting numbers in spreadsheets to catalogue sensory experiences with my fianc√©, Will.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
