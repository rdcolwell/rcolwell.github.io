I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow pursuing my PhD in the <a href='https://mse.washington.edu/'>Materials Science & Engineering Department</a> at the <a href='https://www.washington.edu/'>University of Washington</a>. In <a href='https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/roumeli-research-group/'>Professor Eleftheria Roumeli's group</a>, I explore biomass-derived materials for sustainability applications. I am particularly interested in studying fundamental structure-property relationships to engineer high-performing biomaterials to replace incumbent fossil-derived plastics. 

Previously, I earned my BS in <a href='https://dmse.mit.edu/'>Materials Science & Engineering at MIT</a>, where I conducted a viability study of a low-cost cleaning method for solar panels, advised by <a href='https://jaramillo.mit.edu/'>Prof. Rafael Jaramillo</a>. After graduating, I developed plant-based meat alternatives at <a href='hhttps://www.tenderfood.com/'>Tender Food</a> (f.k.a. Boston Meats). Later, at <a href='https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/'>Amazon Worldwide Sustainability</a>, I tested biobased packaging solutions to derisk solutions while implementing more sustainable materials.

I am also passionate about education and outreach. I have experience as a teaching assistant for various courses, and have volunteered with organizations including <a href='https://stempals.wordpress.com/'>STEM Pals</a>, the <a href='https://www.meet.mit.edu/'>Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow</a>, and the <a href='https://esp.mit.edu/learn/index.html'>Educational Studies Program</a>.

Outside of lab, I keep myself busy with an assortment of activities including: 
<ul>
  <li>Listening to -- and writing -- music</li>
  <li>Experimenting with how to healthify recipes</li>
  <li>Home fermentation projects</li>
  <li>Putting numbers in spreadsheets to catalogue sensory experiences with my fianc√©, Will</li>
</ul>
