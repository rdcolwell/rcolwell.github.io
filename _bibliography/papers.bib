  abstract  = {To understand the experiences of educators during the 2020 extended school closures, we interviewed 40 teachers from across the country in public, charter, and private schools, at different grade levels, and in different subject areas. Teachers articulated three main concerns about emergency remote schooling: 1.) student motivation; 2.) professional loss and burnout; and 3.) exacerbated inequities. As the climate emergency makes school disruptions more common, school systems must learn from the tragic school closings under COVID-19 to prepare for an uncertain future. We propose five design considerations to build school systems with greater resilience for the long-term: center equity, focus on relationship-building, address student motivation, address staff motivation and burnout, and mitigate uncertainty.},

  abstract  = {As schools shift to online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to support disenfranchised populations and keep issues of
equity at the centre of our response. In this study, the authors focus on
supporting one of the few urban-based Indigenous language schools in
the United States because language revitalisation is critical for Native
American communities. The authors explore the extent to which video
conferencing and flipped classrooms support the development of
a community of speakers. The study focuses on a single classroom of 16
students in first through third grade. The authors use a digital decolonisation framework focused on empowering local communities in conjunction
with design-based research methodology to explore contextualised
remote instruction solutions. They report on benefits for the development
of a community of speakers from remote instruction that come with costs
in reduced efficacy of language learning. Finally, they distil those results into preliminary design principles.},
