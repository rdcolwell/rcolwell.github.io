Using a digital decolonization framework and design-based research, the authors studied a classroom of 16 early-grade students.

Findings suggest preliminary design principles for equity-centered, context-specific remote instruction."}],"skills":[{"name":"Lab Techniques","icon":"fa-solid fa-wrench","keywords":["Blown film production","DMA","DSC","FTIR","Optical Microscopy","Mechanical testing","Moisture content & water activity analysis","Polymer extrusion","SEM","TGA","UV-Vis","Viscometry","XRD"]},{"name":"Data Analysis & Software","icon":"fa fa-laptop","keywords":["Autodesk","Excel","GIMP","Fiji/ImageJ","JMP","Mathematica","Python"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"French","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Portuguese","fluency":"Basic","icon":""},{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Basic","icon":""},{"language":"Italian","fluency":"Basic","icon":""},{"language":"Mandarin Chinese","fluency":"Basic","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Materials Science","icon":"fa-solid fa-flask","keywords":["Sustainable materials","Polymer chemistry","Self-assembly"]},{"name":"Personal Interests","icon":"fa-solid fa-leaf","keywords":["Gardening","Home Fermentation","Food Science","Language Learning"]}],"projects":[{"name":"Cocoa Chinese","summary":"Cocoa Chinese is a GitHub repository for a simple GUI to learn Chinese characters with color-coded flash cards to indicate tones.
